## Conference Talks

### "Intro to AngularJS" at [UtahJS 2014](http://conf.utahjs.com/schedule-2014)

[slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/intro-to-angularjs) | [workshop](http://kentcdodds.com/ng-workshop/)

Abstract:

> AngularJS is one of the most popular frontend frameworks out there right now. If you haven't tried it yet, prepare to be amazed! Here's what we'll cover: 
> 
> 1. Templates/Expressions - Your View
> 2. Module - Your app's namespace
> 3. Directives - DOM Interface
> 4. Filters - Display utils
> 5. Scope - What on earth is this thing!?
> 6. Controllers - The View Model
> 7. Services - Common utilities
> 8. Working with third-party modules
> 9. Routing - Single Page App with state in the URL
> 10. Firebase & AngularFire - A full web application with no server setup required!
>
> We'll be following through a repository hosted on GitHub. There's a branch for each concept, so you can play around with the code and then catch right back up with the next branch. So come on, and let's learn AngularJS!

### "Improving UX with GenieJS" at [MidwestJS 2014](http://midwestjs.com/)

[video](https://youtu.be/lqf5mrrf4ZY) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/genie#/) | [workshop](http://kentcdodds.com/genie/workshop/)

Abstract:

> Every time you touch a mouse, a baby seal is ruthlessly tortured and killed. Ok, not really, but I seriously believe that people are so much more productive when they don't need to use the mouse to click on something. One implementation intended to help with this is keyboard shortcuts. Unfortunately, these are limited to the number of sensible keys and key combinations and can be difficult for users to discover, remember, and use. Normally, only super users will ever use them, leaving the rest of your users killing baby seals (ok, seriously, I really don't think that happens...). The goal of genie is to address the problems with keyboard combinations. Genie is a simple library to emulate the same kind of behavior seen in apps like Alfred (for mac: http://alfredapp.com). Essentially, you register actions associated with keywords. Then you can request the genie to perform that action based on the best keyword match for a given keyword. This allows a user to type what they want to have happen and select from a list of the best matches for what they typed to perform an action. Over time, the genie will learn the actions more associated with specific keywords and those will be come first when a list of matching actions is requested.

### "Intro to AngularJS" at [Jfokus 2015](http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/)

Same as above.

### "Using ReactJS with existing AngularJS codebase" at [Jfokus 2015](http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/)

[video](http://kentcdodds.com/react-in-angular/) | [app](http://kentcdodds.com/react-in-angular/app/) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-in-angular)

Abstract:

> ReactJS is an amazing View library that promises (and delivers) high performance, composability, and maintainability. AngularJS is an amazing MV* framework. 
> Tons of shops have adopted and totally bought into AngularJS for their entire frontend application. They're loving it, but some are finding that as these applications get bigger, they can become unwieldy, unperformant, and difficult to reason about. Many of these problems can be solved by doing things better with angular, but not all of them. 
> In this talk, we'll go over why you don't need to re-write your whole application to get some of the wins of React and that it actually is quite easy to integrate the two. We'll talk about where it makes sense to bring in React to an existing Angular codebase and how it works well.

### "JSON powered Forms" at [ng-nl 2015](http://www.ng-nl.org)

[video](https://youtu.be/o90TMDL3OYc) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly-convert)

Abstract:

> We're all really tired of writing the same code for every form. You need a label here and an input here and make sure their IDs are the same and unique and now you want me to add validation!? Daah! I got fed up with this pretty quick and found that I enjoy writing JavaScript a lot more than repeating myself with HTML. If you're like me, then you'll love angular-formly. In this talk, we'll see how you can very easily represent your model with a form using a few lines of JavaScript. You want validation, conditional fields, or custom templates? You need to react to changes to a field? Piece of cake. So come on, and let's make fields less painful and more delightful.

### "ng-model-options in 5 minutes" at [ng-conf 2015](http://www.ng-conf.org/)

[video](https://youtu.be/k3t3ov6xHDw) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng-model-options-in-5-minutes#/) | [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/qocekak/edit) | [blog post](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/ngmodeloptions-total-model-control)

Abstract: 

> Angular 1.3 brought a sweet new directive to the table called ng-model-options. It gives you more control over how your model gets updated and is very easy to use. Get a quick intro and start using this today!

### "Angular 2: Built for Huge, Long-lasting Applications" at [Philly ETE 2015](http://phillyemergingtech.com/sessions/angularjs-2-0-leveling-up/)

[video](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/angularjs-2) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng2-introduction) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ng2-random-user/)

Abstract:

> Angular 2 is built for huge web applications that stand the test of time. To accomplish this, Angular 2 utilizes the latest and greatest web technologies like ES6 modules/classes and Web Components. Come get a preview of what this looks like with Egghead.io instructor Kent C. Dodds as he live codes an application using the pre-release alpha version of Angular 2.

### "angular-formly: Abstracting Away Complexity" at [MidwestJS 2015](http://midwestjs.com)

Abstract:

You need to react to changes to a field? Piece of cake. Oh, and are you worried about the upgrade path to Angular 2.0? Let's talk... So come on, and let's make forms less painful and more delightful.

## Meetup Talks

### "Genie.js" at [UtahJS Orem meetup February 2014](http://www.meetup.com/UtahJS-Orem-Meetup/events/156148202/)

Same as above.

### "Sharing code between Ionic and Web Angular Apps" at [AngularJS Utah meetup April 2014](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/events/160366932/)

This was an impromptu talk while we were waiting for the actual speakers to come, so I'm not on the schedule.

### "How to Build a Demo with GitHub Pages" at [UtahJS Orem meetup August 2014](http://www.meetup.com/UtahJS-Orem-Meetup/events/193499152/)

[slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/gh-pages#/)

### "Watch your Watchers" at [AngularJS Utah meetup August](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/events/184204692/)

[video](https://youtu.be/hFOSXVT-Cps?t=1m34s) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/angular-bindonce#/) | [kcd-angular](http://kentcdodds.com/kcd-angular)

Abstract:

> If you're not careful (especially with your ng-repeats) your watch count in your app can grow pretty quick. This isn't a problem itself, but its what that does to your digest cycle. Lots of watchers makes your digest cycle take longer. In my talk, we'll talk about what Angular 1.3 is doing to help solve this problem, the problem their solution presents, a solution to that problem, and what can be done for pre-Angular 1.3 code.

### "JWT: Not Your Grandma's Cookies" at [AngularJS Utah meetup June](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/events/173788512/)

[video](https://youtu.be/vIGZxeQUUFU?t=1m51s) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng-jwt-workshop) | [site](http://kentcdodds.com/ng-jwt-workshop/frontend/) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ng-jwt-workshop)

Abstract:

> Cookies and sessions are the traditional way to keep track of user state on the server, but it can bite you later. JSON WebTokens (JWT) is a stateless way to deal with users. I'll show how to use $httpInterceptors to make this easy as pie. :-)
