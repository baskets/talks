## Conference Talks

### How to Open Source Your Stuff

[Angular Remote Conf 2015](http://angularremoteconf.com)

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlu3QvuwruY) | [slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/open-sourcing-your-stuff) | [repo 1](https://github.com/kentcdodds/todomvc-angular) | [repo 2](https://github.com/angular-todo-mvc/angular-todo-escape)

Abstract: 

> Modularity is the key to success with large apps. Build things so they work well in isolation, then piece them together to make the full application. One thing that really helps with this kind of strategy is to open source your stuff. In this talk, we'll talk about why you would want to open source your hard earned components. Then we'll take a look at an existing application, identify a good candidate component for open sourcing, and then go through the process of creating an open source project for that component and add it as a project dependency. I hope you like looking at code, because you're going to see a lot of it!

### angular-formly: Abstracting Away Complexity

[MidwestJS 2015](http://midwestjs.com)

[video](https://youtu.be/jUX2zcSwbRE) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly-convert)

Abstract:

> We're all really tired of writing the same code for every form. You need a label here and an input here and make sure their IDs are the same and unique and now you want me to add validation!? Daah! I got fed up with this pretty quick and found that I enjoy writing JavaScript a lot more than repeating myself with HTML. If you're like me, then you'll love angular-formly. In this talk, we'll see how you can very easily represent your model with a form using a few lines of JavaScript. You want validation, conditional fields, or custom templates? You need to react to changes to a field? Piece of cake. Oh, and are you worried about the upgrade path to Angular 2.0? Let's talk... So come on, and let's make forms less painful and more delightful.

### Angular 2: Built for Huge, Long-lasting Applications

[Philly ETE 2015](http://phillyemergingtech.com/sessions/angularjs-2-0-leveling-up/)

[video](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/angularjs-2) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng2-introduction) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ng2-random-user/)

Abstract:

> Angular 2 is built for huge web applications that stand the test of time. To accomplish this, Angular 2 utilizes the latest and greatest web technologies like ES6 modules/classes and Web Components. Come get a preview of what this looks like with Egghead.io instructor Kent C. Dodds as he live codes an application using the pre-release alpha version of Angular 2.

### ng-model-options in 5 minutes

[ng-conf 2015](http://www.ng-conf.org/)

[video](https://youtu.be/k3t3ov6xHDw) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng-model-options-in-5-minutes#/) | [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/qocekak/edit) | [blog post](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/ngmodeloptions-total-model-control)

Abstract: 

> Angular 1.3 brought a sweet new directive to the table called ng-model-options. It gives you more control over how your model gets updated and is very easy to use. Get a quick intro and start using this today!

### JSON powered Forms

[ng-nl 2015](http://www.ng-nl.org)

[video](https://youtu.be/o90TMDL3OYc) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/angular-formly-convert)

### Using ReactJS with existing AngularJS codebase

[Jfokus 2015](http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/)

[video](http://kentcdodds.com/react-in-angular/) | [app](http://kentcdodds.com/react-in-angular/app/) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-in-angular)

Abstract:

> ReactJS is an amazing View library that promises (and delivers) high performance, composability, and maintainability. AngularJS is an amazing MV* framework. 
> Tons of shops have adopted and totally bought into AngularJS for their entire frontend application. They're loving it, but some are finding that as these applications get bigger, they can become unwieldy, unperformant, and difficult to reason about. Many of these problems can be solved by doing things better with angular, but not all of them. 
> In this talk, we'll go over why you don't need to re-write your whole application to get some of the wins of React and that it actually is quite easy to integrate the two. We'll talk about where it makes sense to bring in React to an existing Angular codebase and how it works well.

### Intro to AngularJS

[Jfokus 2015](http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/)

Pretty much the shortened (3 hour) version of my workshop (noted below) in talk format.

### Improving UX with GenieJS

[MidwestJS 2014](http://midwestjs.com/)

[video](https://youtu.be/lqf5mrrf4ZY) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/genie#/) | [workshop](http://kentcdodds.com/genie/workshop/)

Abstract:

> Every time you touch a mouse, a baby seal is ruthlessly tortured and killed. Ok, not really, but I seriously believe that people are so much more productive when they don't need to use the mouse to click on something. One implementation intended to help with this is keyboard shortcuts. Unfortunately, these are limited to the number of sensible keys and key combinations and can be difficult for users to discover, remember, and use. Normally, only super users will ever use them, leaving the rest of your users killing baby seals (ok, seriously, I really don't think that happens...). The goal of genie is to address the problems with keyboard combinations. Genie is a simple library to emulate the same kind of behavior seen in apps like Alfred (for mac: http://alfredapp.com). Essentially, you register actions associated with keywords. Then you can request the genie to perform that action based on the best keyword match for a given keyword. This allows a user to type what they want to have happen and select from a list of the best matches for what they typed to perform an action. Over time, the genie will learn the actions more associated with specific keywords and those will be come first when a list of matching actions is requested.

### Moxee: Enforcing modularity in AngularJS

[AngularJS Utah meetup March 2015](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/events/221087489/)

[slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/moxee#/) | [repo](https://github.com/alianza-dev/moxee)

### JWT: Not Your Grandma's Cookies

[AngularJS Utah meetup June](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/events/173788512/)

[video](https://youtu.be/vIGZxeQUUFU?t=1m51s) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/ng-jwt-workshop) | [site](http://kentcdodds.com/ng-jwt-workshop/frontend/) | [repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ng-jwt-workshop)

Abstract:

> Cookies and sessions are the traditional way to keep track of user state on the server, but it can bite you later. JSON WebTokens (JWT) is a stateless way to deal with users. I'll show how to use $httpInterceptors to make this easy as pie. :-)

### Using ReactJS with existing AngularJS codebase

[ReactJS Utah meetup January 2015](http://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Utah/events/219204576/)

Same as above.

### Watch your Watchers

[AngularJS Utah meetup August](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Utah/events/184204692/)

[video](https://youtu.be/hFOSXVT-Cps?t=1m34s) | [slides](http://slides.com/kentcdodds/angular-bindonce#/) | [kcd-angular](http://kentcdodds.com/kcd-angular)

Abstract:

> If you're not careful (especially with your ng-repeats) your watch count in your app can grow pretty quick. This isn't a problem itself, but its what that does to your digest cycle. Lots of watchers makes your digest cycle take longer. In my talk, we'll talk about what Angular 1.3 is doing to help solve this problem, the problem their solution presents, a solution to that problem, and what can be done for pre-Angular 1.3 code.

## Workshops

### ES6 Workshop

[MidwestJS 2015](http://midwestjs.com/)

[slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/es6-workshop) | [workshop](https://github.com/kentcdodds/es6-workshop) | [video 1](https://youtu.be/aeY6ctvsurs) | [video 2](https://youtu.be/a96r7Tjf0Ps)

Abstract:

> JavaScript is tons of fun to program in. But it only gets better with the next iteration on the language! Super sad that you have to support ES5 browsers until the end of time? Worry no more! With modern tools, you can start coding ES6 right now. Come to this training to learn how to set this up in your own project and start developing applications of the future today! The goal of this course is to get you thinking with the mind of an ES6 JavaScripter and that you’ll take that knowledge home to your projects to level-up your development. You wont be able to help yourself when we’re done :-)
